# Download

## Haxe

First, you will need to install Haxe and Neko. OpenFL uses Haxe to power the build process, and Neko to run the command-line tools. Both are included in the following installers, one for each platform:

 * [Windows](http://haxe.org/website-content/downloads/3.2.1/downloads/haxe-3.2.1-win.exe)
 * [Mac](http://haxe.org/website-content/downloads/3.2.1/downloads/haxe-3.2.1-osx-installer.pkg)
 * [Linux](http://haxe.org/download/linux)

## OpenFL

With the latest versions of Haxe and Neko installed, open a command-prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) and run these commands:

    haxelib install openfl
    haxelib run openfl setup

To confirm that OpenFL is installed and working properly, try running the "openfl" command:

    openfl

If you are upgrading, you can find more information about changes <a href="https://github.com/openfl/lime/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openfl/openfl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Next Steps

Now that OpenFL is installed, you can [choose a code editor](/learn/resources/choosing-a-code-editor/) or [pick a tutorial](/learn/) and get started!
